# DBC Active Plans

## Evidence-first alpha activation

Status: completed locally on 2026-07-28; awaiting review and commit approval.

- Make Run the default, low-friction path.
- Keep provider, policy, and recovery tools under Advanced.
- Let evaluators complete a deterministic browser lifecycle without side effects.
- Make EvidencePack and the human acceptance decision the visible outcome.
- Enforce evidence completeness in CI and release workflows.
- Prepare, but do not claim, signed and notarized macOS distribution.
- Use the 30-day go-to-market plan to recruit design partners and publish proof stories.

Next checkpoint: configure Apple credentials, produce a signed release candidate, and
verify both architectures before publishing Homebrew installation instructions.

## Priority product improvements

Status: P0 and operator-facing P1 completed and verified locally on 2026-08-05;
awaiting review and commit approval.

- Scope Run, Approvals, Evidence, costs, and decisions to the current HarnessRun.
- Replace the technical nine-part progress model with Describe, Run checks, Decide.
- Keep acceptance/path controls available behind an optional disclosure.
- Make Evidence an explicit empty state until a run exists and a read-only decision
  surface once evidence is available.
- Collapse provider routing, command policy, sessions, and diagnostics under advanced
  Settings.
- Cover the new UI contracts in deterministic smoke checks and desktop tests.

The updated local arm64 application was rebuilt, installed, and launch-checked on
2026-08-05. Next checkpoint: review and commit these changes, then manually verify a
signed/notarized universal macOS release after Apple credentials are available.
